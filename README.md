# Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio

## Project Description
This project analyzes the risk and return of financial assets using the Sharpe Ratio, providing investors with insights into the risk-adjusted return of their investments.

## Features
- Calculation of the Sharpe Ratio for different assets.
- Visual representation of asset returns and volatility.
- Comparison of asset performances based on the Sharpe Ratio.

## Installation Instructions

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone url-to-your-repository
